## 🌪️ The Problem
Esports scouting is currently broken. Data is siloed in private spreadsheets, talent contracts are opaque, and the transfer of pro-players often involves payment disputes and long delays. Scouts have no way to verify a player's true market value or track their historical performance win-points (WP) in a tamper-proof way.

**And when opportunity strikes — a tournament, a buyout window, a rival guild making moves — independent scouts often can't act fast enough. Not because their roster isn't valuable. Because it's all locked up in contracts they can't easily liquidate.**

## 🛡️ The Soroban Solution
ScoutGrid leverages the **Stellar (Soroban)** blockchain to create a high-performance, transparent marketplace for professional gaming talent — with a built-in financial system that lets scouts leverage what they already own.
- **On-Chain Profiles**: Every player is a unique contract entry, storing WP, roles, and verified achievements directly on the ledger.
- **Atomic Escrow**: Bidding and Buyouts are handled by trustless smart contracts. Funds are only transferred when ownership is secured.
- **Royalty Enforcement**: Contract transfers include automated royalty logic (10% to the original scout/agency) enforced at the protocol level.
- **Collateral Lending**: Scouts can lock player contracts as on-chain collateral to borrow XLM from the community pool — unlocking capital without selling their assets. Loan terms scale with a player's Win Points.
- **AI-Advisor (Nova)**: A Gemini-powered intelligence layer that scans the live blockchain registry to give scouts real-time tactical advice.


---

## 🚀 Core Functions & Features
- **The Marketplace**: A real-time grid to browse, bid on, or buyout pro-gaming contracts.
- **The Roster (Dossier)**: Personal collection management. Track your "Secured Contracts" and "Active Offers."
- **Win-Point (WP) System**: On-chain reputation tracking that increases based on verified tournament performance.
- **Nova AI Advisor**: Interrogate a high-performance AI that knows every contract on the grid to find undervalued talent.
- **Minting Terminal**: Agency tools to deploy new pro-profiles directly to the network.
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Any scout can connect via Freighter, Albedo, xBull, or HOT Wallet to bid, buy, or sell — wallet-agnostic by design.
- **Collateral Loan System**: Lock a player contract to borrow XLM from the on-chain pool. WP-tiered loan-to-value ratios. Compound interest. Liquidation-on-expiry with community repo auction.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
Browser (React + Vite)
 |-- StellarWalletsKit        (Multi-wallet abstraction layer)
 |   |-- FreighterModule      (Browser extension — Stellar.org)
 |   |-- AlbedoModule         (Web-based signer)
 |   |-- xBullModule          (Mobile-first wallet)
 |   └── HotWalletModule      (NEAR-connected multi-chain wallet)
 |-- @stellar/stellar-sdk     (Transaction building & RPC interaction)
 |-- Universal Sync Engine    (On-chain state management via Zustand)
 |-- Gemini AI SDK            (Intelligence layer & Tactical analysis)

Stellar Testnet
 |-- ScoutGrid Soroban Contract (Marketplace logic, Escrows, Royalties)
 |-- Stellar Asset Contract     (SEP-41 Native XLM payments)
```

> **Zero Backend Requirement**: ScoutGrid has no centralized database. All escrow states, royalties, and win-points live natively on-chain. The Universal Sync Engine mirrors the ledger state for real-time UI updates.

---

## 🛠️ System Components
- **"Global Registry"**: A single-source-of-truth registry maintained on the Soroban ledger, ensuring all scouts see the same talent data instantly.
- **Universal Sync Engine**: A high-performance convergence engine on the frontend that parallelizes on-chain registry fetches with local metadata enrichment.
- **Contract Hardening**: Robust Rust-based logic with exhaustive checks for ownership, bid validity, and state protection.
- **Blockchain-First State**: All roster and marketplace updates hit the on-chain registry first, ensuring changes are visible to all browsers globally with zero stale state.

### Implementation Details:
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (Cyberpunk/Glassmorphism UI).
- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban (Rust SDK) deployed on Stellar Testnet.
- **Wallet Integration**: `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit` — unified multi-wallet layer supporting Freighter, Albedo, xBull, and HOT Wallet. Any wallet can bid, buy, sell, or borrow.
- **AI Layer**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for market analysis and natural language queries.
- **State Management**: Zustand for high-performance, real-time marketplace and loan state syncing.
- **Transaction Notifications**: Custom Toast system delivering live feedback at every stage — simulate, approve, submit, confirm, or failure.
- **DeFi Loan Engine**: WP-tiered LTV ratios (50–80%), compound interest per 30-day term, liquidation-on-expiry with community repo auction. All enforced on-chain — zero counterparty trust required.

### 🔒 Security, Error Handling & Transactions
ScoutGrid implements rigorous on-chain architecture alongside high-fidelity UI tracking to ensure absolute transparency during every operation.

**On-Chain Error Handling (Soroban):**
The underlying Rust smart contract natively catches, handles, and reverts **15 distinct error states** (`ContractError` enum), including:
- `AlreadyInitialized` & `NotInitialized`: Protects administrator and registry core configuration.
- `Unauthorized`: Prevents unauthorized actors from transferring contracts or spoofing identities.
- `BidTooLow` & `InvalidAmount`: Ensures escrow pricing mechanics are strictly enforced.
- `NotRegistered` & `UserAlreadyRegistered`: Maintains pristine player registration states.
- `NoActiveBid` & `ProfileAlreadyExists`: Prevents duplicate database entries and dead-end executions.
- `LoanAlreadyExists` & `NoActiveLoan`: Prevents double-pledging and phantom repayments.
- `InsufficientPool` & `ExceedsLTV`: Guards the lending pool against over-leverage.
- `CollateralNotOwned`: Ensures only the current contract owner can pledge an asset.
- `LoanNotExpired`: Prevents premature liquidation calls.

**Real-Time Transaction Status (Frontend):**
On the client side, every single interaction (Bidding, Minting, Buyouts, Registration) is channeled through our custom Universal Sync Engine, keeping scouts fully informed of execution progress:
- Every action triggers live state tracking steps visually (e.g., `"Simulating on Soroban..."`, `"Initiating Buyout..."`, `"Claiming Handle..."`).
- The engine actively polls the Soroban RPC `getTransaction` status locally, resolving only upon on-chain finality.
- Successful transactions return instantaneous positive confirmation and instantly refresh the global grid state. Wallet rejections or simulation failures are caught and surfaced as toast notifications with the exact error from the contract.

## 🚀 Live Interface Walkthrough

### 🔐 Multi-Wallet Connection
ScoutGrid supports four wallet providers via a unified picker modal powered by `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit`. Scouts can connect, bid, buy, and sell using any supported wallet — the contract interaction layer is completely wallet-agnostic.

| Wallet | Type | Connection Method | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Freighter** | Browser Extension | Extension popup → approve | Recommended for development. Full tx signing. |
| **Albedo** | Web-based | In-page modal → approve | No install required. Works in any browser. |
| **xBull** | Mobile / Extension | Extension or deeplink → approve | Mobile-first. Full Soroban tx support. |
| **HOT Wallet** | Multi-chain | Web modal → approve | NEAR-connected. Identity verified via connection; registration shown in demo mode. |

#### Cross-Wallet Transaction History (Stellar Testnet)
The following screenshots show the same marketplace actions — bid, buyout, and sell — executed from different wallet providers, all verifiable on the Stellar ledger.

| Action | Wallet Used | Stellar Explorer |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Place Bid | Freighter | ![Bid TX — Freighter](./frontend/ui_images/TX_Bid_Freighter.png) |

| Accept Bid (Sell) | xBull | ![Sell TX — xBull](./frontend/ui_images/TX_Sell_xBull.png) |
| Identity Verified | HOT Wallet | *(Demo mode — identity verified via wallet connection; on-chain registration requires funded testnet account)* |

> All transactions above are publicly verifiable at [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet) using the contract address `CCB3PY3PW6HYPLTXYT2EYVXW7TXBFDE6ALH3MSSWSKI4IZYO67JGQQED`.

---

### 🛡️ Identity & Onboarding
Every scout's journey begins with a wallet connection followed by handle registration. Wallet ownership is verified via a cryptographic signature challenge at connection time.

> **Note:** On-chain IGN registration (`register_user`) writes to the Stellar contract and requires a small gas fee in XLM. For the hackathon demo, wallet connection and identity verification are shown fully functional — the handle is claimed locally after the wallet signature is verified. Full on-chain registration is live and callable on Testnet for wallets with funded accounts (e.g. Freighter + Friendbot).

## 💡 Real-World Use Case: Kai's Story

> Kai is an independent esports scout. After months of scouting, he mints two player profiles on ScoutGrid — **Renz** (Jungler, listed at 3,000 XLM) and **Dae** (Roamer, listed at 2,000 XLM). A major regional tournament drops with a **4,000 XLM entry fee** and an 80,000 XLM prize pool. His team is ready. His roster is battle-tested.
>
> **Kai only has 600 XLM.**
>
> The old system: a guild funds him in exchange for **30% of prize winnings and partial co-ownership** of his player contracts. That's the system ScoutGrid was built to disrupt.
>
> **The ScoutGrid way**: Kai opens the Roster page. He locks Renz's contract as collateral (0 WP → 50% LTV → borrows 1,500 XLM). He locks Dae's contract (borrows 1,000 XLM). He now has 3,100 XLM — enough to enter and have runway.
>
> His team finishes **second place**. 18,000 XLM prize. He repays both loans with interest. His contracts are unlocked and re-listed. **Full ownership intact. No guild cut. No dilution.**

This is not a hypothetical — this is asset-backed lending applied to esports. The same mechanic behind mortgages, margin accounts, and invoice financing. ScoutGrid brings it on-chain.

### 🏦 WP-Tiered Loan-to-Value (LTV) Table
A player's reputation directly determines borrowing power. Better players unlock better credit terms.

| Win Points | Max LTV | Example (3,000 XLM list price) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 WP | 50% | 1,500 XLM max borrow |
| 1–2 WP | 55% | 1,650 XLM max borrow |
| 3–5 WP | 65% | 1,950 XLM max borrow |
| 6–9 WP | 72% | 2,160 XLM max borrow |
| 10+ WP | 80% | 2,400 XLM max borrow |

> Interest compounds at **5% per 30-day term**. Unpaid loans can be liquidated — the contract transfers to admin for community repo auction with a protocol fee.

## 👥 Target Users
- **Esports Agencies**: To manage and monetize their rosters with protocol-enforced royalties.
- **Pro Scouts**: To find undervalued talent using on-chain performance data and AI analysis.
- **Professional Players**: To gain ownership of their performance history and ensure instant contract payments.

## 🧱 Challenges Faced
- **Contract Data Enrichment**: Soroban maps are heavy on gas. We overcame this by implementing a **Unified Sync Engine** on the frontend that merges on-chain ownership data with profile metadata for a seamless UI experience.
- **Real-Time Consistency**: Syncing bidding states across multiple scouts (browsers) required a high-performance polling architecture to ensure no "front-running" of manual buyouts.
- **Multi-Wallet Abstraction**: Replacing hard-coded Freighter calls with a wallet-agnostic layer required migrating all transaction signing through `StellarWalletsKit` and resolving Protocol 22 XDR incompatibilities introduced by the `@stellar/stellar-sdk` v15 upgrade. Each wallet provider (browser extension, web-based, hardware) required its own connection and signing flow while the contract layer remained identical.
- **Bargain Bid Mechanics**: The contract implements a reverse-price bidding model — scouts bid *below* the list price and the owner accepts the best offer. Enforcing this correctly required removing a directional bid guard (which incorrectly blocked valid lower bids from replacing higher ones) and ensuring `list_price` is updated to the accepted bid on transfer, so secondary-sale royalty logic always operates on the correct baseline.
- **Collateral Loan Design**: Implementing compound interest in `no_std` Rust (no floating point) required integer math with per-term iteration — `repayment += repayment * 500 / 10_000` per term — which mirrors financial compound logic without precision loss. WP-tiered LTV required a match-based dispatch function callable both from contract logic and indirectly from the test suite. Differentiating "unlisted because sold" from "unlisted because collateralized" is handled by the existence of a `LoanRecord` key rather than a new profile field, keeping the schema clean.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
- **[ ] Player Dashboard**: A dedicated view for players to verify their own stats and upload achievements.
- **[ ] DAO Governance**: Allow top scouts (highest WP) to vote on tournament verification and WP multipliers.
- **[ ] IPFS Integration**: Storing player high-resolution assets and tournament clips.
- **[ ] Mobile Dossier**: A lightweight mobile app for scouts on-the-go.
- **[ ] Guild Liquidity Providers**: Open the lending pool to any guild — contributors earn a proportional share of interest revenue, turning the pool into a yield-generating protocol.
- **[ ] Upgrade Function**: Add `upgrade` entrypoint to the contract so future deployments preserve the same contract ID and existing on-chain data.
- **[ ] Repo Auction UI**: Dedicated "Repo Grid" tab surfacing liquidated contracts available for community bidding at discounted prices.
